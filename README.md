For the DevHack1.0 team -
  Install all python packages given in requirements.txt
  To deploy it to your localhost, run 'python Table_app.py' Now, just open 'localhost:5000' in your browser

Note -
  1. It's better to use a virtual environment, create it using [virtualenv](https://djangocentral.com/how-to-a-create-virtual-environment-for-python/)
  2. The port number maybe different, if you have specified the port number, at the app.run() line in the code, though default is port:5000
  3. For this flask runs in debug mode
